# Four Corners 3D
A classic playground game in 3D using React, Three.js, and R3F (React Three Fiber).

## 🕹️ How to Play
1. Click the **Start** button.
2. Watch for the corners to flash.
3. **Move your player** (the blue sphere) to any corner **except** the one that is flashing.
4. If you are caught in the highlighted corner, it's Game Over!

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **React** - UI Logic
* **Three.js / React-Three-Fiber** - 3D Rendering
* **Netlify** - Hosting

##Task 1: Set up the development environment

**Configured React and React-Three-Fiber environment.**

**Initialized Git and established a GitHub repository for version control.**

## Task 2: Plan the project

**Defined game logic for a 3D space.**

**Mapped out the coordinate system for the 3D arena.**

## Task 3: Implement core features

**Developed 3D assets** (player sphere, corner slabs) using Three.js primitives.

##Task 4: Test the application

**Tested collision logic and "Game Over" triggers.**

**Debugged state updates between the UI and the 3D Canvas.**

## Task 5: Document the project

**Created a comprehensive README for user guidance.**

## Task 6: Finalize and submit

**Deployed the application via Netlify.**

## Project Skills Learned
**3D Math & Rendering**: Understanding Vector positions and 3D space.

**State Management**: Managing game phases (Start, Playing, Game Over) in React.

**Version Control:** use of Git/GitHub for project tracking.

## Development Process Used
**Agile Method**: Focused on iterative development, starting with a basic 3D scene and layered on movement, then logic.
